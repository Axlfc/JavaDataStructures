# Java Data Structures.
This repository will help me as a programmer to better remember how data structures work and are implemented in Java.

First I plan to learn how a Java project is started, then I'll be trying to implement basic Primitive types as examples.

## Data Types
### Primitives

#### - Boolean (true or false)
    
#### - Character
    
#### - Floating-point numbers, limited-precision approximations of real number values.
##### Including single-precision and double-precision IEEE 754 floats, among others

#### - Fixed-point numbers
    
#### - Integer, integral or fixed-precision values
    
#### - Reference (also called a pointer or handle), a small value referring to another object's address in memory, possibly a much larger one
    
#### - Enumerated type, a small set of uniquely named values

#### - Date Time, value referring to Date and Time

<br/><br/>

### Composite types or non-primitive type

#### - Array (as an example String which is an array of characters)
#### - Record also called structure
#### - Union (Tagged union is a subset, also called variant, variant record, discriminated union, or disjoint union)

<br/><br/>
