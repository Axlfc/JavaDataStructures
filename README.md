# Java Data Structures.
This repository will help me as a programmer to better remember how data structures work and are implemented in Java.

First I plan to learn how a Java project is started, then I'll be trying to implement basic Primitive types as examples.

[Link to be my guide path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures)

## Primitives

### - Boolean (true or false)
    
### - Character
    
### - Floating-point numbers, limited-precision approximations of real number values.
#### Including single-precision and double-precision IEEE 754 floats, among others

### - Fixed-point numbers
    
### - Integer, integral or fixed-precision values
    
### - Reference (also called a pointer or handle), a small value referring to another object's address in memory, possibly a much larger one
    
### - Enumerated type, a small set of uniquely named values

### - Date Time, value referring to Date and Time
